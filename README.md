# MyReads - A Project In Udacity's React Nanodegree Program

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Overall, MyReads is a simple web application that can help you keep track of books based on 3 categories

- Currently Reading
- Want to Read
- Read

It also allow you to look for new books based on the search functionality

MyReads allows me (as a learner) to apply React fundamentals I've learned from the course such as : 

- Create components with JSX 
- Break down components into smaller part (you can see it in my components folder, where I break down 2 pages into smaller pieces)
- Simple state management with UseState hooks
- Basic use of UseEffect hooks for page re-render based on state
- The use of Route, Routes and Link to navigate between sites
